4. Create the repository

### Step 2: Upload Your Code
Run these commands in your project folder:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and start deploying

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add:
- `DATABASE_URL` = `file:./db/prod.db`
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 5: Done! ðŸŽ‰
Your website will be live in 2-3 minutes with a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## Alternative Platforms

### Render (Good Alternative)
- URL: [render.com](https://render.com)
- Free tier available

- Start Command: `npm start`

### DigitalOcean App Platform
- URL: [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)

## Important Notes

1. **Images**: Make sure to add your portfolio images to the `/public/my-designs/` folder
2. **Database**: Currently using SQLite (perfect for portfolio sites)
3. **Socket.IO**: Your custom server supports real-time features
4. **SSL**: All platforms provide free SSL certificates
5. **Custom Domain**: Available on all paid tiers

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in your platform dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Make sure all images exist in the public folder
4. Check that the build completes successfully locally first

### Common Issues:
- **Port Error**: Make sure `PORT` environment variable is set correctly (most platforms set this automatically)
- **Database Error**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set properly
- **Build Error**: Run `npm run build` locally first to check for issues

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions
2. Look at the platform's documentation
3. Check the deployment logs for specific error messages
